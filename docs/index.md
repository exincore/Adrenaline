Noradrenaline is a minimal modpack forked from [Adrenaline](https://intergrav.github.io/Adrenaline/) which contains a few minimal quality-of-life features. It is designed to stay nearly indistinguishable from vanilla.

## ➕ Features
### 🏳️‍🌈 Quilt!
Noradrenaline uses the Quilt Modloader, whereas Adrenaline uses Fabric.

**Beware!** Quilt is in beta development. Noradrenaline releases will be marked as beta as well. As always, keep (and test!) a solid backup and restore strategy.

### 🔥 Extreme Optimization!
Noradrenaline is built upon Adrenaline, a highly optimized modpack. Adrenaline claims "It can improve the framerate **up to ten times**!"

### 🧩 Few QOL Mods!
Noradrenaline comes with [Inspecio](https://modrinth.com/mod/inspecio), [Dynamic Crosshair](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshair), [LampDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights), and minimal-configured [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) to liven the player's presence.

Minimal-configured [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat) is included as well.

### ⏩ Quick Updates!
Noradrenaline will attempt to stay up to date with Adrenaline's updates.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions
### 🔧 How do I install it?
Noradrenaline is installed like Adrenaline.

Here is a quick video that shows how to install it. The process should be very similar on most launchers. **Make sure you have all the dependencies for it**! All are linked in the description of the video.

### 📦 Can I make a modpack with this?
Yes, *you can*! Feel free to use this in any way you want! If you are making something public with this like a modpack, all I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put this website in there.

### 💬 How can I provide feedback?
If you are asking for a feature to be added or giving a bug report, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/exincore/Noradrenaline/issues). Thanks!

## ♻️ Versioning
Noradrenaline uses Adrenaline's versioning system.
