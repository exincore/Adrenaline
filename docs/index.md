Noradrenaline is a minimal modpack forked from [Adrenaline](https://intergrav.github.io/Adrenaline/) with subtle quality-of-life features. It is designed to stay nearly indistinguishable from vanilla.

## ➕ Features
### 🏳️‍🌈 Quilt!
Noradrenaline uses the Quilt Modloader, whereas Adrenaline uses Fabric.

**Beware!** Quilt is in beta development. As always, keep (and test!) a solid backup and restore strategy.

### 🔥 Extreme Optimization!
Noradrenaline is built upon Adrenaline, a highly optimized modpack. Adrenaline claims "It can improve the framerate **up to ten times**!"

### 🧩 Few QOL Mods!
Noradrenaline bundles...
* [Inspecio](https://modrinth.com/mod/inspecio)'s sensible tooltips,
* [Dynamic Crosshair](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamiccrosshair)'s world-responsive interface,
* [LampDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights)'s natural light, and
* [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin)'s subtle game-mechanic reveal  
...to liven the player's presence.

[Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat) is tucked away for convenience.

Noradrenaline includes configuration that maintains a low profile that cuts out more conspicuous mod features and options. It is designed to achieve the most Vanilla feel right from the start.

### ⏩ Quick Updates!
Noradrenaline will attempt to stay up to date with Adrenaline.

### 📦 Can I make a modpack with this?
> Yes, *you can*! Feel free to use this in any way you want! If you are making something public with this like a modpack, all I ask for is credit somewhere. You don't **have** to give credit - after all it's just a Minecraft modpack, but I spend lots of time maintaining this and it would help a ton. If you do want to give credit, just put this website in there.

## ♻️ Versioning
Noradrenaline uses [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Versions for older Minecraft releases will try to replicate the latest stable version. This makes it super simple, but older versions may have less features as many mods can be missing.

This goes for newer, alpha versions as well. However, they will continue to be updated with multiple alpha stages until it has the same mods as the previous version.

I stop support for older versions over time, but it isn't mandatory to update as they should still be very stable.
