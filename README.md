## 🏳️‍🌈 Quilt

This modpack only works with Quilt. The Quilt modloader aims to be backwards compatible with Fabric mods.

## ⏩ Updates

Noradrenaline is maintained in spare time and motivation, and will see periods of inactivity or sparse testing. However, since the modpack is fairly simple, included mods can usually be updated manually on a launcher such as [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/) without incompatabilities.
